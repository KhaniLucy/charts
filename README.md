This sheet is information of a company that can be displayed in form of a table, graph, or diagram. Therefore this chart displays the total amount the company brings over each month in a year. 

This chart was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. JavaScript and CSS are the core builders of the chart. 

And CSS is also found inside the JavaScript because it will be great to separate the app's styling with the charts styling for better interaction of the company. 

When hovering the charts show the exact revenue amount in million Rands.
